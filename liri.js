// 9. Make it so liri.js can take in one of the following commands:

//    * `concert-this`

//    * `spotify-this-song`

//    * `movie-this`

//    * `do-what-it-says`

// ### What Each Command Should Do

// 1. `node liri.js concert-this <artist/band name here>`

var command=process.argv[2]
var concert = process.argv[3]

if (concert="concert-this"){

}
//    * This will search the Bands in Town Artist Events API (`"https://rest.bandsintown.com/artists/" + artist + "/events?app_id=codingbootcamp"`) for an artist and render the following information about each event to the terminal:

//      * Name of the venue

//      * Venue location

//      * Date of the Event (use moment to format this as "MM/DD/YYYY")

//      What was the trick we went over in class to get arrays/objects to display cleanly 
//         (or as clean as possible) in terminal?
//      JSON.stringify(obj, null, 2);

// 2. `node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'`
// http://open.spotify.com/track/6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6

//    * This will show the following information about the song in your terminal/bash window

//      * Artist(s)

//      * The song's name

//      * A preview link of the song from Spotify

//      * The album that the song is from

//    * If no song is provided then your program will default to "The Sign" by Ace of Base.

//    * You will utilize the [node-spotify-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api) package in order to retrieve song information from the Spotify API.

//    * The Spotify API requires you sign up as a developer to generate the necessary credentials. You can follow these steps in order to generate a **client id** and **client secret**:

//    * Step One: Visit <https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/>

//    * Step Two: Either login to your existing Spotify account or create a new one (a free account is fine) and log in.

//    * Step Three: Once logged in, navigate to <https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications/create> to register a new application to be used with the Spotify API. You can fill in whatever you'd like for these fields. When finished, click the "complete" button.

//    * Step Four: On the next screen, scroll down to where you see your client id and client secret. Copy these values down somewhere, you'll need them to use the Spotify API and the [node-spotify-api package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api).

// 3. `node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>'`
// Store all of the arguments in an array
var movie-this = process.argv[2];
var movieName = process.argv[3];

// Create an empty variable for holding the movie name
var movieName = "";

// Loop through all the words in the node argument
// And do a little for-loop magic to handle the inclusion of "+"s
for (var i = 2; i < nodeArgs.length; i++) {
  if (i > 2 && i < nodeArgs.length) {
    movieName = movieName + "+" + nodeArgs[i];
  }
  else {
    movieName += nodeArgs[i];
  }
}

// Then run a request with axios to the OMDB API with the movie specifiedttp://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt3896198
var queryUrl = "http://www.omdbapi.com/i=tt3896198" + movieName + "&apikey=ea24388d";

// This line is just to help us debug against the actual URL.
console.log(queryUrl);

axios.get(queryUrl).then(
  function(response) {
    console.log("Title: " + response.data.Title)
    console.log("Year: " + response.data.Year);
    console.log("Rating: " + response.data.Rating);
    console.log("Rotten Tomatoes Rating: " + response.data.tomatoRating);
    console.log("Country: " + response.data.Country);
    console.log("Language: " + response.data.Language);
    console.log("Plot: " + response.data.Plot);
    console.log("Actors: " + response.data.Actors);
  });

//    * If the user doesn't type a movie in, the program will output data for the movie 'Mr. Nobody.'

//      * If you haven't watched "Mr. Nobody," then you should: <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0485947/>

//      * It's on Netflix!

//    * You'll use the `axios` package to retrieve data from the OMDB API. Like all of the in-class activities, the OMDB API requires an API key. You may use `trilogy`.

// 4. `node liri.js do-what-it-says`

//    * Using the `fs` Node package, LIRI will take the text inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI's commands.

//      * It should run `spotify-this-song` for "I Want it That Way," as follows the text in `random.txt`.

//      * Edit the text in random.txt to test out the feature for movie-this and concert-this.
